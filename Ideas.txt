Tools Ideas:
- brush tool for stochastic asset placemement (in engine)
	- will include an object density value (e.g. foliage density) 
	  and may include a % weighting per object e.g. less likely to paint a tree than a bush
	- requirements 
		- interaction with terrain
		- allowing user to select a group of object to paint with
		- erase functionality - removes object in zone that are part of the paint group
		- objects made are individual, allowing post paint tweaking of position
		- % desnity
		- % object weighting
		- target layer - paint objects to that layer
		- layer / tag selection to paint on
			- paint objects ontop of that layer 
			  e.g. objets at appropriate y level to terrain, ignore buildings y level

- auto terrain generator (in engine)
	- will include noise value, max difference value for y variance
	- requirements
		- noise value
		- post creation paint style modification of height - both increase and decrease?
		- target layer - layer to put terrain on
		- have user place 2 points in space and terrain is generated between those 2 points 

- auto path for tilemaps (in engine)
	- can include tile groups for specific tile types e.g. one side, bottom left corner, full
	- % weight for each tile within type groups
