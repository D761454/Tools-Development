# Tools Development
  
A Stochastic Asset Placement Tool Built for Unity.

Prefabs can be assigned Weightings and assigned to Weighted Groups.
The Brush can have altered size and density, with a default brush and a faded edges brush.

The modified tool allows the saving and loading of palettes for future use with zones, this can also be used for the brush tool to negate having to re-define each group everytime the engine is closed and opened.
