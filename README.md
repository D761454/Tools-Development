# Tools Development
  
A Stochastic Asset Placement Tool Built for Unity.

Prefabs can be assigned Weightings and assigned to Weighted Groups.
The Brush can have altered size and density, with a default brush and a faded edges brush.

All files should be in one folder but UXML refs break when doing this and cause errors (these dont break the tool but are annoying)
