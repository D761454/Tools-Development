Tools Ideas:
- brush tool for stochastic asset placement (in engine)
	- will include an object density value (e.g. foliage density) 
	  and may include a % weighting per object e.g. less likely to paint a tree than a bush
	- requirements 
		- interaction with terrain - align created object’s up axis to the surface normal direction
		- allowing user to select a group of object to paint with
		- erase functionality - removes object in zone that are part of the paint group
		- objects made are individual, allowing post paint tweaking of position
		- % density
		- % object weighting
		- target layer - paint objects to that layer
		- layer / tag selection to paint on
			- paint objects on top of that layer 
			  e.g. objects at appropriate y level to terrain, ignore buildings y level

- auto terrain generator (in engine)
	- will include noise value, max difference value for y variance
	- requirements
		- noise value
		- post creation paint style modification of height - both increase and decrease?
		- target layer - layer to put terrain on
		- have user place 2 points in space and terrain is generated between those 2 points

Idea 1: Stochastic asset placement brush (Unity)
Research: 
https://discussions.unity.com/t/released-object-placement-tool/678804 
https://discussions.unity.com/t/props-placement-tool/877227
https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/tools/utilities/easy-placement-tool-273061?srsltid=AfmBOori0_gHU-NKGXOoty31uY6P151sAX2kb0D_n-juQ3laeD3qaoaE

Goal: 
allow the user to brush across a region, randomly placing objects from user made object groups, each with % weightings. Ignoring specific layers.
This would speed up both the creation of open world game regions, such as forests, and out of bounds but visible sections of levels in games.

Aspects from research in Mine:
- object alignment to surface normal direction.
- group objects - I will use this to group based on type e.g. tree, to use alongside % weighting
- objects placed can be individually tweaked after as they will be placed as individual objects
- brush based for paint / erase

overall pseudocode:
Inputs: 
- Brush pos on terrain, 
- brush size, 
- terrain within brush bounds, 
- obj groups to paint from, 
- % density
- % weightings to determine which group to use and which item in group to use,
- target layer,
- ignore layers,
- array of painted to positions

- if painting
	- take area within brush 
		- go through each position in specified terrain layer (every terrain position at 0.5 x and y position perhaps)
			- if not painted to
				- set as painted to (prevents constant repainting when dragging)
				- gen number based on density value
				- if draw obj
					- get terrain at pos surface normal direction
					- gen number for which obj group to use
						- gen number for what obj within the group to use
				- place object on target layer, rotated to match surface normal direction
- if erasing
	- take area within brush 
		- go through each position in specified terrain layer (every terrain position at 0.5 x and y position perhaps)
			- if painted to
				- set as not painted to
				- get obj at position of target layer
				- if obj in any of the groups
					- delete object

Idea 2: Auto Terrain Generator (Unity)
Research: 
https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/tools/terrain/terrain-generator-140538?srsltid=AfmBOooBP0sxVyympgdVpJNzgB-aFKFj-1_BiV4P7MIfzXjNNkJ0ZjPD 
https://www.procedural-worlds.com/products/indie/gaia/
https://www.pinwheelstud.io/vista

Goal: 
auto generate terrain on a specified layer using a user specified noise value. will also make use of "stamps" to specify features e.g. mountains
This would speed up terrain creation for both smooth and noisy terrain for large world sections, islands or even open worlds.

Aspects from research in mine:
- stamps to specify terrain features generated
- sliders to modify values for noise
