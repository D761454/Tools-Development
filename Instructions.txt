1. read info sheet and sign a copy of the consent form
- all documents - questionnaire, info sheet, consent form, palette instructions, are within the project folder

2. boot up shareX (screen recording) or OBS - muted.

3. download the CAAP, Tool1 and Tool2 branches on git hub
- each branch is its own unity project with everything included
- in unity hub, add the unzipped folder from disc an open it - one at a time as they likely have the same name

4. read the palette instructions pptx,
- this will show the general composition of biomes, and will also show any settings that need to be edited on tools and how to open the tool initially.

5. for each tool, start a recording using the recording software of choice.

6. use each tool to fill each scene - small, medium and large using the palette instructions,
- each sized scene must be timed separately,
- timing begins on editing the tool UI in the scene,
- !!! NOTE: THIS DOES NOT INCLUDE EDITING TOOL2 SETTINGS FROM THE PALETTE INSTRUCTIONS !!!

7. once you have filled the large scene with a tool, delete and refill the red biome using that tool, timing that separately as well.

8. end the recording and repeat step 5 onward for the other 2 tools.

9. changes to the branches caused by level editing can be discarded.

10. fill out the questionnaire - uploading consent form and recordings via questionnaire.
