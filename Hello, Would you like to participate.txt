Hello, Would you like to participate in my study for my dissertation project?

I have created an object placement tool in Unity, seeking to determine if the addition of contextual awareness will speed up the development of non-procedural game scenes.

To participate, you must read the information sheet and sign the consent form.

Following this, you should download the Tool1, Tool2 and CAAPT branches, (these must be deleted once finished).

The Consent form, Information sheet and Questionnaire link are within the repository.

Thank you for your time.
