Hello, Would you like to participate in my study for my dissertation project?
I have created an object placement tool in Unity, seeking to determine if the addition of contextual awareness will speed up the development of non-procedural game scenes.

To participate, you must read the information sheet and sign the consent form.

Following this, you should download the Tool1, Tool2 and CAAPT branches, (these must be deleted once finished).

Using each tool, you must fill the 3 scenes in the project according to the power point detailing the objects per biome.

For each scene, you should time the time taken to fill it and for each tool you should record filling all 3 scenes.

Finally, you would fill out the questionnaire.

Thank you for your time.
